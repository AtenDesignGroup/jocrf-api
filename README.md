# JOCRF API

JOCRF API using the open source Blueprint API for Apiary.

## Usage

Hosted and accessible at [https://jocrf.docs.apiary.io](https://jocrf.docs.apiary.io)

## Contributing

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run watch-compile
```
__All changes are made to files in `src/`, do not edit `apiary.apib` directly. This file is compiled by `npm`.__

If you've made changes directly using apiary's web editor, you'll need to transfer those edits to the corresponding include files in `src/` so these changes won't be overridden on the next `watch-compile`.
